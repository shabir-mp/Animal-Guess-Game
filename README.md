## About
A simple word guessing game using animals as the word list. In this game, you will try to guess an animal word by guessing letters. If a letter in your guess matches a letter in the secret word, the letter will be revealed. You have a maximum of 6 incorrect guesses before you lose the game. If you correctly guess all the letters in the word before reaching the maximum number of incorrect guesses, you win the game.

## How To
To play the game, open the source coede file in a web browser or, you can go to [This Link](https://shabir-mp.github.io/Animal-Guess-Game/). You will see a grid with boxes for each letter in the secret word, an area for your guesses, an area for the message (win/lose/instructions), and a set of buttons for each letter in the alphabet. When you click on a letter button, the letter will be added to your guesses and any matching letters in the secret word will be revealed. If the letter you guessed is not in the secret word, one of your incorrect guesses will be used up. After each guess, the game will check if you have won or lost.
